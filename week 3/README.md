Working of the image slider:

It starts by creating the JavaScript variable currentImageIndex, which keeps track of the image . It begins at 0, which represents the array's first image.
The file paths of the images that will be displayed in the slider are stored in an array called images.
The interval variable, which controls the interval between image changes, is set to 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).
The changeImage function is defined.
This function is responsible for updating the source (src) attribute of the HTML image element with the name "slide" to display the next image in the array. It also updates the currentImageIndex to ensure it loops back to the beginning when it reaches the end of the image array.
The changeImage function is called at predetermined intervals—in this case, every three seconds—using the setInterval function. The automatic image transition in the slider is started at this interval.
Additionally, the changeImage function will be launched by an event listener once the page has fully loaded. This makes sure that the first image loads with the page and is immediately visible.

Working of the form:

The form includes various input fields for the user's information, such as username, email, password, and password confirmation. Each input field is contained within a div element with the class "input-control," making it easier to style and manage.
The validateInput function is introduced, which serves as the core validation mechanism. This function takes an input field, an associated error message element, and an optional regular expression (regex) for validation purposes.
validateInput first trims the input value to remove any leading or trailing spaces.
It then checks if the trimmed value is empty (blank). If it is, it displays an error message in red to visually indicate an issue. When the input is valid (not empty and matching the regex), it clears the error message and adds a green border to signify a successful input.
It uses querySelectorAll to select all input fields within elements having the "input-control" class. For each input field, a "blur" event listener is set up. This listener uses the validateInput function to validate the input based on the type of field (e.g., email or password). This provides real-time feedback to users.
The code also addresses form submission. When the "Submit" button is clicked, the following steps occur:
It iterates through all input fields, validating them.
If any input field fails validation, the valid variable is set to false.
It specifically checks that the password and confirm password fields match.
If all checks pass, it shows an alert indicating successful form submission.
